LAOS
====

A program to look at the security of the IEEE RTS 96 using PSAT in Matlab. Python is used to generate the files to test. 

A program called kiribati makes a batch file containing a list of scenarios to simulate.
this is read by laos which will call matlab with a script to perform the desired simulation. The results are parsed by logparser.py

Notes
=====

 * It seems like a waste to start up and shut down matlab for every simulation.
 * There might be a way to trip out and modify a system while matlab is running in a way that will be much quicker to run

To Try
======

 - Settings.distrsw = 1 % use distributed slack bus
 - Settings.init % status (including PF diverged!)
 - OPF.conv % did the OPF converge
 - OPF.report % not sure but should be checked out
 - clpsat.refresh = 0 % don't bother re-running the PF
 - clpsat.showopf % not sure
